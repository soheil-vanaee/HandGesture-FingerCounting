# HandGesture-FingerCounting
A Python application for real-time finger counting using OpenCV and MediaPipe. This project uses a webcam to detect and count open fingers, providing a visualization of hand landmarks. It leverages MediaPipe's hand tracking solution for accurate and efficient detection.

# Features
- Real-time hand detection using a webcam.
- Counts the number of fingers that are open for each detected hand.
- Visualizes hand landmarks and hand connections on the video feed.
